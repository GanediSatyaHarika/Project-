    INTRODUCTION
The library code project is developed to simulate a basic library management system. It allows users to perform various operations such as creating personal accounts, adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and searching for books in the library , due date to return and fine pending.
    
    FEATURES
The library code project provides the following features:
    1. Registration : users can register their accounts by providing information such as their name , ID  number, password and contact number.
    2. Login : users can login into their accounts by providing their name , ID number , password.
    3. Borrowing Books: Users can borrow books from the library by specifying the book's unique identifier or book name.it also shows the availability of books over there.The system will keep track of the borrower's information and the due          date for returning the book.
    4. Returning Books: Users can return borrowed books to the library. The system will update the book's availability and remove the borrower's information.
    5. User profile : users can get their complete details like name, ID , contact number , number of books borrowed , fine pending in their profile.
    6. Logout: users can use logout function to get exit.
